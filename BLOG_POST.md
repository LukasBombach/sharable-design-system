# The problem of CSS we try to solve

In this post you will learn why CSS is designed the way it is and why this troubles the young and aspiring web devloper. We will be discussing the ways in which current CSS libraries solve these problems and why they still give you a subtle nausea here and there.

## CSS, the good, the bad and the ugly

We all love to hate CSS just a little. It's gotten a bad rep latelyâ€”for good reasonsâ€”but that wasn't always the case. [CSS used to be the cool kid in town](http://www.csszengarden.com/). So what's changed? Let's take a look.

## A bit of history

To understand why CSS is designed the way it is, we have to take a quick look at its history. In the olden days, the tech industry had to figure out how to display and store "rich text" on a computer. Rich text is text that allows styling words in bold or italic, adding "rich media" like images or videos and do layouting (i.e. determining text flow and placing things). The opposite of this is "plain text", which really can only show characters and does not provide any way to control the text layout of your text.

Working with rich text might sound very uninspiring today, but figuring out how to implement rich text was a big deal. Remember, there was a time where working with computers meant sitting infront of a terminal with a usually black background and a single colored text and that was it. And even with a graphical user interface, such as that of Windows 3.1, implementing rich text is by no means a trivial task.

To implement rich text you have to find an effecive way of rendering the text, which is a whole topic of its own and one that is incredibly advanced and not part of this article. But you also have to figure out how to store your text so you can tell your renderer which part of your text is bold, where you want to show an image and if you want that image to interrupt your text flow or be embedded in it.

There are a lot of approaches to do this. You might know `something.rtf` files, the `r`ich `t`ext `f`ormat from Windows. If you were to open it in your code editor, you would find something like this:

```rtf
 {\rtf1\ansi{\fonttbl\f0\fswiss Helvetica;}\f0\pard
 This is some {\b bold} text.\par
 }
```

which will render

> This is some **bold** text.

If I were to write the same text in Markdown, I would write

```markdown
This is some **bold** text.
```

Now what these two have in common is that we need to annotate the text _inline_ with our style definitions. This works well for many use-cases, I personally find writing markdown very pleasing, but imagine having to implement entire web apps with inline annotations. Also, especially on the web, it would be harder to separate semantics from styles, which might affect accessibility on one way or another.

Another way to do this is by separating these annotations from the text itself. This was already a practice before computers entered the stage. In publishing, as part of the [prepress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepress), typesetters could be given a sheet of styles that they would apply to the text when setting up the print.

## Enter CSS

Well, you now might already see where CSS is coming from. CSS spelled out, is Cascading _Style Sheets_. I know ðŸ¤¯, right?

You might also get a feeling that CSS really is made for text documents, right? While that might not completely hold true today, to my understanding, this is what the crux of

## Why CSS <del><em>is bad</em></del> does not fit our needs

CSS is really great for (hyper) text documents. I mean _really_ great. With only a few lines of code, you can express so much.

```css
body {
  font-size: 1.4rem;
  color: #4c4c4c;
}

p {
  font-size: 1rem;
  padding-bottom: 1rem;
}

p + h2 {
  padding-bottom: 2rem;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 2rem;
  color: #000;
}
```

little code for small bandwith, separates presentation from semantics, dynamic to content combinations

but there are already so many problems for our

## `X` types of problems

To better navigate how to use CSS it helps to understand where you are stuck so you can get of of your stuckiness

### The language is not specific to our domain

The language often does not express our intend.

A lot of things that _we_ do, like spacing things or centering can be done in many many ways. It's often unclear which properties there are to solve a problem and once you understand there are 5 different ways to do a things, it's even harder to make the right choice

// todo work with a code example here, take spacing, there is padding, margin, flex and grid with gaps, there is positioning, relative and absolute.

This is true for properties and it is true for selectors.

# -- -- NOTES -- --

two types of problems

1. css gets ugly, side effects, hard to navigate, you want a thing, but css does not give you the one answer for this
2. scoping and architecture

problem scoping

many solutions

bem, css modules, styled components and its derivates

but this does not cut it

next problem =
we have compoenents but no architecture

other type of solutions

css gets ugly, side effects, hard to navigate, you want a thing, but css does not give you the one answer for this

tailwind -> it just works

## what you want

abstractions that

- "just work"
- support implementing your architecture

## Naming things

zero runtime should be zero cost abstraction
utility first ist just an abstraction
